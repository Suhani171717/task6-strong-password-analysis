# Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation and Best Practices

 Objective  
Understand what makes a password strong, test multiple passwords using an online strength tool (PasswordMeter), analyze the feedback, and learn common password attacks.



 Tools Used  
- [PasswordMeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com)  
- Google Search (for attack research)  



 Password Strength Evaluation  

| Password           | Strength Rating | Estimated Crack Time     | Key Feedback                    |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| password123        | Weak            | < 1 second              | Common password, lacks complexity |
| Qwerty@2025        | Medium          | ~5 hours                | Predictable pattern             |
| M@yAnK#786         | Strong          | 12 years (est.)         | Good use of symbols and numbers |
| S@huNiPandey$98    | Strong          | 2 million years (est.)  | Long and complex                |
| %L0ckM3D0wn_!2024  | Very Strong     | 24 million years (est.) | Excellent complexity and length |

 Best Practices Learned  

 Use 12+ characters minimum  
 Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters  
 Avoid real words, names, or **common sequences 
 Use random strings or meaningful passphrases 
 Longer and more unpredictable passwords increase security drastically  



 Common Password Attack Techniques  

 1. Brute Force Attack  
Tries all possible combinations. Strong, long, and random passwords make brute-force impractical.

 2. Dictionary Attack  
Uses common passwords or words. Avoid using real dictionary words or names to mitigate.

 3. Phishing  
Tricks users into revealing passwords. Defeated by user awareness, safe browsing habits, and 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication).


Why Password Complexity Matters  

Strong passwords:  
- Are exponentially harder to guess  
- Resist automated cracking tools  
- Extend the time needed for brute-force attacks from seconds to millions of years  



 Conclusion  

Password strength is a key part of cybersecurity. This task demonstrated how increasing complexity and randomness significantly improve password security. Simple changes—like increasing length and adding special characters—make a huge difference in protecting accounts from attacks.
